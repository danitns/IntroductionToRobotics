# Introduction To Robotics - Homeworks
Repo created for "Introduction to Robotics" course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework present clear requirements, guidelines, implementation details, code samples, and accompanying image files.

## Homework 2
**Task**: Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.\

## Homework 4
**Task**: You will use the joystick to control the position of the segment and ”draw” on the display. The movement between segments should be natural, meaning they should jump from the current position only to neighbors, but without passing through ”walls”.

## Homework 6
**Task**: An Arduino-based project for environmental monitoring and logging. Utilizes EEPROM-stored values, RGB LED control, and integrates sensors for real-time data. Features a structured menu system for user interaction.
